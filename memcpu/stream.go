// Sample program that takes a stream of bytes and looks for the bytes
// “elvis” and when they are found, replace them with “Elvis”. The code
// cannot assume that there are any line feeds or other delimiters in the
// stream and the code must assume that the stream is of any arbitrary length.
// The solution cannot meaningfully buffer to the end of the stream and
// then process the replacement.
