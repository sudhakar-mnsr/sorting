Blocking Profiling
Testing and Tracing allows us to see blocking profiles.

Running a Test Based Blocking Profile
We can get blocking profiles by running a test.

Generate a block profile from running the test.

$ go test -blockprofile block.out
Run the pprof tool to view the blocking profile.

$ go tool pprof block.out
Review the TestLatency function.

$ list TestLatency
Running a Trace
Once you have a test established you can use the -trace trace.out option with the go test tool.

Generate a trace from running the test.

$ go test -trace trace.out
Run the trace tool to review the trace.

$ go tool trace trace.out
